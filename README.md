# Enhanced Assortment Optimization and Restocking

## Problem Statement
In the ever-evolving world of retail, efficient assortment optimization and restocking are crucial for maintaining high customer satisfaction and maximizing profitability.
As one of the largest retailers globally, Walmart faces unique challenges in ensuring that the right products are available in the right quantities at the right time.
Our project aims to enhance these processes through advanced analytics and innovative strategies.

## Solution

Developed a solution that integrates data-driven insights with cutting-edge technology to optimize product assortment and streamline restocking. Approach focuses on three key objectives:
1. **Demand Forecasting**predicting future product demand. We leverage advanced analytics to forecast demand by analyzing historical data, market trends, regional factors, and external variables. This allows Walmart to anticipate customer needs more accurately and adjust inventory levels proactively.
2. **Inventory Management**maintaining optimal inventory levels. Our solution determines the precise timing and quantity of stock orders. By accurately predicting these factors, we help Walmart minimize excess inventory, reduce stockouts, and ensure product availability aligns with customer demand.
3. **Warehouse Management**optimizing warehouse operations. We improve warehouse layout, product placement, and picking strategies to enhance overall efficiency. This leads to reduced picking times and streamlined operations, which are crucial for meeting the demands of a large-scale retailer like Walmart.
Together, these objectives are designed to enhance Walmart’s supply chain efficiency, reduce costs, and ultimately improve customer satisfaction.

## Tech Stack

Python for its versatility and extensive libraries.
NumPy for numerical computing.
Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
TensorFlow and Keras for developing and training machine learning models.
Scikit-learn for implementing algorithms like linear regression and gradient boosting.
Matplotlib for data visualization.
SQL for database management.
React for creating an interactive web interface.
These technologies provide a robust framework for data handling, model building, and delivering insights through a user-friendly interface.

## Data Analysis

Started by gathering a variety of data, including historical sales figures, market trends, regional information, and other external variables. This data undergoes a thorough cleaning process to handle any missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Then transformed and prepared the data by extracting relevant features, such as seasonal patterns and trends, which are crucial for accurate forecasting.
To understand the temporal patterns in the historical data, used time series models like ARIMA. These models help to capture linear trends and seasonality, giving a foundational baseline for forecasts. It will also help in making real-time future predictions.

## Machine Learning Algorithms

Linear Regression is one of the simplest and most widely used statistical techniques. Its primary purpose is to model the relationship between a dependent variable (like sales) and one or more independent variables (like pricing or promotions). It's straightforward and provides an initial trend prediction. Then coming to Random Forests, this technique addresses more complex, non-linear relationships in the data. Random Forests is an ensemble learning technique that builds multiple decision trees and merges their results. It improves our model's ability to manage intricate data structures. By averaging the predictions of several decision trees, Random Forests reduces the risk of overfitting and enhances the model’s robustness and accuracy.
Gradient Boosting is a method that combines the predictions of several weak models to create a strong predictive model. Its general purpose is to iteratively improve model performance by focusing on errors made by previous models. It refines our predictive capabilities by focusing on complex patterns and interactions in the data. By continuously adjusting and optimizing, Gradient Boosting checks for all possible values and selects the best prediction, which significantly increases accuracy.
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks are a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) designed to handle sequential data. LSTMs are particularly effective for forecasting future demand based on historical sequences. They remember information over long periods, which is crucial for understanding and predicting trends and patterns in time series data. Combined the strengths of both time series and machine learning approaches to create a hybrid model. This integration leverages traditional methods for linear trends and advanced techniques for non-linear patterns, resulting in a more accurate forecasting framework.
Our models generate predictions for future product demand, which help determine optimal inventory levels. For instance, the Linear Regression model guides restocking decisions. If inventory falls below the predicted level, an automated notification system triggers alerts to ensure timely restocking and prevent understocking or overstocking issues.

## Conclusion

Our demand forecasting and inventory management solution, which is easily integrated into a React-based website, uses powerful machine learning algorithms and real-time data to make accurate forecasts and optimize inventories. Users benefit from timely replenishment notifications and easy engagement with forecasted data.
